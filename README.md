In my Object Detection Project using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, I implemented a system that detects and classifies objects in real-time using a live webcam feed. The YOLOv8 model is utilized to accurately identify various objects, such as people, vehicles, and everyday items, directly from the webcam stream. The system draws bounding boxes around detected objects and labels them with their corresponding class names and confidence scores. This project demonstrates efficient real-time processing, leveraging the lightweight architecture of YOLOv8 for high-speed performance while maintaining accuracy in object recognition.
